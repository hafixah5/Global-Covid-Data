Dataset can be obtained from this [website.](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
This project focuses on the death and infection data during the pandemic. Hence, before starting the project, the dataset was splitted to take only the necessary information.

A [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nu4818/viz/CovidDeathDashboard_16479646825520/Dashboard1) of this project was made using Tableau. 
Some of the explored data shown are a chart of Death Count by Continent and an interactive map of Percent Population Infected according to each Country.
